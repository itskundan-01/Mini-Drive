## 🔐 HOW TO ACCESS ADMIN PANEL

### Method 1: Using the Promotion Script (Easiest)

**Step 1:** Create a regular user account first
- Go to http://localhost:5173
- Click "Sign Up"
- Register with email: `admin@test.com` (or any email)
- Password: `admin123` (or any password)

**Step 2:** Run the promotion script
```bash
cd backend
node promoteToAdmin.js admin@test.com
```

**Step 3:** Login again
- Logout if you're logged in
- Login with the admin credentials
- You'll automatically be redirected to `/admin/dashboard`

### Method 2: Using MongoDB Shell (mongosh)

**Step 1:** Create a regular user (same as above)

**Step 2:** Open MongoDB shell and promote user
```bash
mongosh
```

Then in mongosh:
```javascript
use mini-drive

// Find your user
db.users.find({ email: "admin@test.com" })

// Promote to admin
db.users.updateOne(
  { email: "admin@test.com" },
  { $set: { role: "admin" } }
)

// Verify
db.users.findOne({ email: "admin@test.com" })
```

**Step 3:** Login again with admin credentials

### Method 3: During Registration (API Call)

You can also create an admin user directly via the API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Admin User",
    "email": "admin@test.com",
    "password": "admin123",
    "role": "admin"
  }'
```
